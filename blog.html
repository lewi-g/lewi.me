  <h2>My Programmer beginnings</h2>
  <p>Today is the first day of 2018. Over the past 5ish years,
    I've made an effort to figur out how to be the best Lewi possible. I 
    worked hard at knowing my needs and communicating better. 
  </p>
  <p>After finishing the Thinkful immersive in JavaScript Programming, it 
    has become more and more apparent that I need to think of how I want to
    tackle becoming a better programmer and performer in this field. I have 
    learned a lot of tools. The difficulty has been figuring out what to 
    concentrate on. The Seventh Habit is to "sharpen the saw". 
  </p>
  <p>This blog will serve as documentation of my efforts to become a more
    efficient and effective programmer. 
  </p>
  <h4>Enjoy the show!</h4>
