        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I have written end-to-end tests for an in-house sales tracking app using Cypress. I have ran summer camps teaching HTML, CSS and JS to children ages 7 to 14.
         Iâ€™m excited about exploring opportunities to grow as a software developer.</p>
        <p>When not building sites, I spend time training to run a sub-3 hour marathon, cooking, reading, teaching and performing swing dances</p>
